Monday, October 7th, creation of initial repo, readme.md, notebook.md and code directory.

Wednesday, October 16th, uploaded clipped.py, which produces both a sine wave and a clipped sine wave in .wav format.

Friday, November 1st, created readin.py, a program wich can read in .wav files and plot them on a graph.

Saturday, November 2nd, created fourier.py, a program which can create Fourier transforms of a specified sine wave.

Sunday, November 10th, created filters.py, which contains a low pass filter for now.  It shows how quickly the high frequency "noise" on a graph can be claned up, leaving only the original low-frequency sine wave.

Wednesday, November, 13th, created add.py, a program that adds together three sine waves and analyses the fourier transform of the waves.  This shows that the  fourier transform can not only be used to isolate the specific component frequencies that make up a combined wave, but also used to isolate the amplitude of these component waves individually.
