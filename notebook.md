Monday, October 7th, creation of initial repo, readme.md, notebook.md and code directory.

Wednesday, October 16th, uploaded clipped.py, which produces both a sine wave and a clipped sine wave in .wav format.

Friday, November 1st, created readin.py, a program wich can read in .wav files and plot them on a graph.

Saturday, November 2nd, created fourier.py, a program which can create Fourier transforms of a specified sine wave.

Sunday, November 10th, created filters.py, which contains a low pass filter for now.  It shows how quickly the high frequency "noise" on a graph can be claned up, leaving only the original low-frequency sine wave.
